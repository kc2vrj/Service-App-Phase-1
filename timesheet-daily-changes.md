## Analysis of Changes Needed

The current `timesheet-daily.js` file shows clear signs of problematic changes that need to be reverted:

1. There are two complete `return` statements in the component (lines 47-67 and 117-158)
2. There appears to be duplicate state management code

Before making changes, we need access to the git history to properly revert the last 2 changes. Please provide git access or the specific details of the last 2 changes so we can properly revert them.

Without direct git access, we can observe that the following issues need to be fixed:
1. Remove the duplicate return statement (likely the first one at lines 47-67)
2. Consolidate the error and loading handling
3. Maintain the more complete TimesheetForm implementation from the second return statement

Please provide git history access so we can properly revert the specific changes rather than attempting to manually reconstruct the previous state.
